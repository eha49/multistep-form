Multistep form is one of the most common UI component found on the web. The design is one of challenges listed on the Frontend Mentors site, categorized under 'Advanced'.

I took this challenge to practice my React skills particulary the state management using Context API which proved helpful here as I needed to share the state across different 'forms'.

I chose React to build this because dividing the entire app into re-usable components imporves the Developer Experience considerably.

This project is not completed as I have not implemented the responsiveness and accessibility features yet. I chose not to focus on these issues for now as I wanted to strengthen my core React skills and get some repitition on the basic CSS stuff.

Also, any multistep component requires routing to work efficiently. I have not implemented that, instead I have relied on conditionally rendering different form components. I hope to implement the routing feature in the near future.
